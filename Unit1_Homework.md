# FINTECH CASE STUDY

## Overview and Origin

* The Zillow Group

* 2006

* Richard Barton, Lloyd Frink, Spencer Rascoff, Dabid Beitel, & Kristin Acker

* Founders previously started Expedia. Strategy was to publicized (connect) data to consumers that previously was secret.

* Founders capital


## Business Activities:

* Residential real estate was long the domain of local agents, hoarding information and data about purchases, sales, room counts, square footage and other critical information in the market for buying and selling homes. Their technology, known as "MLS", evolved from index cards in files into closed data networks. The moat was, these data repositories were not publically accessible and much of the information was proprietary (ie, how many days was this home listed before selling). Zillow endeavored to build its own data from public sources, and lower the veil on this secret world - empowering the buyers/sellers.

* The company's intended customers are multitude, but at the end of the day the residential buyer/seller is the main target. The size of this market is vast, there are in excess of 5 million homes bought and sold annually in the US of A.
Over years of building their proprietary models and data sets, Zillow has a relatively unassailable position in the market as the "google" of home buying. Redfin is attempting to challenge them by offering a complementary agent service.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* Zillow uses a variet of technologies, including machine learning and AI.

* On demand home valuations (ie "Zestimate") have dramatically increased in availability and accuracy, putting enormous pressure on the traditional realtor/client interaction.

* Redfin, Realtor.com


## Results

* The biggest impact by far that Zillow has made on the market is the collapsing of transaction commissions. In 1991 the average residential real estate commission in the US of A exceeded 6%. For 2020, the national average was 4.94%. When you consider that there are $80bb in transactions per year, this is a huge savings for consumers. 

* Web traffic, ad sales, and referal clicks are all sky high at Zillow.

* Zillow dominates the entire industry. 


## Recommendations

* If I advised zillow, I would be directing spending and development of but AR and VR offerings for people to view homes. This is relevant not only for these pandemic times, but for migration. People can more easily see houses from afar. 

* This would help Zillow reach more consumers in a more meaningful way.

* Augmented and Virtual Reality.

* People want to walk around houses.
